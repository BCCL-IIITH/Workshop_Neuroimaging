# Summary of the introductory session: Understanding MRI scans and Breadth of datasets & Softwares

The goal of this session is to introduce you to several concepts in handling
 the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired on humans. This session
 will help you get started with the processing of the MRI data including:
different formats of the MRI files, types of MR modalities that are commonly
 acquired and more importantly a prerequisite for the upcoming sessions.

Neuroimaging has been bringing in terabytes of high-resolution functional
and anatomical brain images, uncovering the neural basis of individual
 differences in behavior and cognition. The most prominent examples
are [[OpenNeuro]](#1), [[the Human Connectome Project]](#2), [[the NKI-Rockland sample]](#3),
[[the UK Biobank]](#4), [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) and soon.

It is also important to recognize a multitude of preprocessing and analysis software packages
for reproducible science in Neuroimaging. To name a few [[A Practical Guide for Generating Reproducible and Programmatic Neuroimaging Visualizations]](#5).
