# Welcome!
Hello everyone and welcome to the "MRI and EEG data analysis" workshop conducted at the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad organized by Brain, Cognition and Computation Lab, we're glad to see you here!

# Overview of the workshop

The overall idea of this workshop is to train attendees how to begin with brain data analysis, 
 familiarize with Neuroimaging workflows/pipelines that include processing multiple modalities
of Neuroimaging.

 Broadly, this workshop is conducted over 5 days. In the initial days, we will try to provide 
brief overview of the data types and data organization that the Neuroimaging community prefer
followed by basics in data handling such that the stage is set for actual data analysis/workflows.

This workshop utilizes pre-coded packages or softwares that are easy to download and install. Mostly
coded in Python, MATLAB, C++ etc. For hands on practicising, we can rely on Jupyter notebooks. 
All the content will be provided in Jupyter notebooks.
