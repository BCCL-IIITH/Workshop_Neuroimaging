# Welcome!
Hello everyone and welcome to the "MRI and EEG data analysis" workshop that will take place
at the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad organized by Brain, Cognition and Computation Lab.

# Overview of the workshop

The overall idea of this workshop is to train attendees how to begin with brain data analysis, 
 familiarize with Neuroimaging workflows/pipelines that include processing multiple modalities
of Neuroimaging.

 Broadly, this workshop is conducted every Saturday starting from August 3rd 2024 that runs over approximately 3 months. In the initial days, we will try to provide brief overview of the data types and data organization that the Neuroimaging community prefer, followed by basics in data handling and visualization such that the stage is set for actual data analysis/workflows. For a precise outline of this workshop, please consult the respective [page](outline "Outline of the workshop").

This workshop utilizes pre-coded packages or softwares that are easy to download and install. Mostly
coded in Python, MATLAB, C++ etc. For hands on practicising, we can rely on Jupyter notebooks. 
All the content will be provided in Jupyter notebooks or bash scripts.
