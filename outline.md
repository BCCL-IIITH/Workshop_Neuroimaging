# Outline

The Neuroimaging workflow workshop will be conducted into distinct parts organized according the
modality. While the first day will be focussed on `Introduction to MRI` that covers conversion
from DICOM `.dcm` to NIFTI format `.nii`, data organization in BIDS and also going through
 `basics in data handling` with `nilearn` and `nipype`. The following days 
will entail examples of dedicated `advanced and specialized analyses` specific to each
imaging such as Strcutural MRI (sMRI), Functional MRI (functional connectivity),
 diffusion MRI (structural connectivity) and modeling with EEG signals.
 As mentioned before, these resources will contain all materials utilized in the workshop.
Our **very optimistic** schedule looks as follows:
