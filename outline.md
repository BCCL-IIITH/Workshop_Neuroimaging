# Outline

The Neuroimaging workflow workshop will be conducted into distinct parts organized according the
modality. While the first day will be focussed on `Introduction to MRI` that covers conversion
from DICOM `.dcm` to NIFTI format `.nii`, data organization in BIDS and also going through
 `basics in data handling` with `nilearn` and `nipype`. The second half 
will entail examples of dedicated `advanced and specialized analyses` within which folks will also evaluate the discussed topics. As mentioned before, these resources will contain all materials utilized in the workshop. In general, we will aim for 4 h per session. Our **very optimistic** schedule looks as follows (all times in IST):
